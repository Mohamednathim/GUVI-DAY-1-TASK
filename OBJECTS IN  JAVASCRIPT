OBJECTS:
        # In JavaScripts, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties.
        # The object type represents one of JavaScript's data types.It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.
        # Objects can be created using the Objects() constructor or the object initializer/ literal syntax.
TYPES:
      Built-in Objects:
                       Which are provided by javascript core. Things likeArrays,strings, number,boolean are all built-in objects.
      User-defined objects:
                        These are objects which you have created in your program or application.

DIFFERENCE WAYS OF CREATING AN OBJECTS IN JAVASCRIPT:
       1.Using the object() constructor:
               var d= new objects();
       2.Using object.create() method:
               var d= object.create();
       3.Using fuction constructor:      
               var obj= junction(name)
                   {
                    this name.name;
                   }
               var c= new obj("hello")
        4.Using function constructor + prototype:
                function myobj()
                    {

                    };
                myobj.prototype.name="hello";
                    var k= new myobj();
        5.Using singleton pattern:
                var 1= new fuction()
                    {
                      this.name="hello";
                    }
